# A simple, clean 1U rack-mount case.

Intended to be fabricated from cut & folded 16g steel, but the front panel could be a 3D print if you have a big enough printer.

## Notes:
* Power connector: [Huaconn HC-99-F1](http://www.huaconn.net/product-detail-604.html)
* PSU(s): [MeanWell LRS series](https://www.meanwell.com/meanwell_products.html)
  * LRS-35 & LRS 50 are both 82.0mm x 92.5mm x 30mm
  * LRS-75 is wider at 97.0mm x 92.5mm x 30mm
  * LRS-100, LRS-150 & LRS-200 are substantially larger
  * (Models from 350W up have fans that are unsuitable for use in a 1U case)
  * Their [LOP series](https://www.meanwell.com/meanwell_products.html) open frame PSUs are also an option.  (Easier active cooling & higher power are options with them...)
* Cooling fan(s): [Noctua NF-A4x20](https://www.noctua.at/en/products/nf-a4x20-pwm)

## to be done:
* Learn how to convert the parts into something I can order from, say, Send-Cut-Send.
* Add in holes for assembly using machine screws.
